## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously and appreciate your help in keeping ByteSnake and its users safe.

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **Do NOT** discuss the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed
3. Send an email to [security@bytesnake.com](mailto:security@bytesnake.com) with:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested fixes (if you have them)

### What to Include

Please include as much of the following information as possible:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., XSS, code injection, data exposure)
- **Affected components** (Python version, Web version, or both)
- **Severity level** (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- **Proof of concept** or steps to reproduce
- **Potential impact** on users
- **Suggested remediation** (if known)

### Response Timeline

We will respond to security reports within **48 hours** and provide:

- Confirmation that we received your report
- Initial assessment of the vulnerability
- Timeline for investigation and fix
- Regular updates on our progress

### Severity Levels

#### Critical
- Remote code execution
- Data breach or unauthorized access to user data
- Complete system compromise

#### High
- Privilege escalation
- Significant data exposure
- Denial of service affecting all users

#### Medium
- Limited data exposure
- Local privilege escalation
- Denial of service affecting some users

#### Low
- Information disclosure
- Minor security bypasses
- Cosmetic security issues

### Security Measures

ByteSnake implements the following security practices:

#### Python Version
- **Input validation** for all user inputs
- **Safe file operations** with proper error handling
- **No external dependencies** beyond pygame
- **Local storage only** (no network communication)

#### Web Version
- **Client-side only** (no server communication)
- **Input sanitization** for all user interactions
- **Safe DOM manipulation** practices
- **LocalStorage only** (no external data transmission)

### Security Best Practices for Users

#### General
- Keep your Python installation updated
- Use modern browsers for the web version
- Don't run the game from untrusted sources
- Report suspicious behavior immediately

#### Python Version
- Run in a virtual environment when possible
- Don't run with elevated privileges
- Check file permissions on highscore.txt

#### Web Version
- Use HTTPS when hosting the web version
- Keep your browser updated
- Don't disable security features
- Be cautious with browser extensions

### Known Security Considerations

#### Python Version
- **File system access**: Game can read/write highscore.txt
- **No network access**: Game doesn't communicate over the network
- **Local execution**: Runs with user's permissions

#### Web Version
- **Browser security**: Subject to browser security policies
- **LocalStorage**: Data stored locally in browser
- **No server communication**: All processing happens client-side
- **Canvas API**: Uses standard web APIs

### Security Updates

Security updates will be released as:
- **Patch releases** for critical vulnerabilities
- **Minor releases** for high/medium severity issues
- **Documentation updates** for low severity issues

### Disclosure Policy

- Vulnerabilities will be disclosed after fixes are available
- We will credit security researchers (unless they prefer anonymity)
- Public disclosure timeline: 90 days after initial report
- Coordinated disclosure preferred

### Contact Information

For security-related questions or reports:

- **Email**: [security@bytesnake.com](mailto:security@bytesnake.com)
- **Response time**: Within 48 hours
- **PGP Key**: Available upon request

### Acknowledgments

We thank the security community for helping keep ByteSnake safe. Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be acknowledged in our security advisories.
